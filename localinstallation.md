# Overview
This file provides additional information relevant to cloud foundry service providers. 

# Buildpack Components

* Zend Server 6.2 Free/Enterprise edition
* Zend Server 6.2 configuration files
* PHP 5.4
* Nginx web server
 

# Local Installation
You can optionally install the cartridge in yout local Cloud Foundry environment if you want it to be available as a system buildpack. This enables cartridge "auto detection" and adds it to the menu of cartridges presented by the cf utility. If you do not wish to install, skip this stage and go directly to the usage section.

# Requirements
* Working Cloud Foundry v2 environment with dea_ng and gorouter
* The lucid64 Cloud Foundry stack should be installed and enabled - check settings in /vagrant/dea_ng/config/dea.yml
* xz compression utility - it is installed automatically by vagrant if you follow the guide below

The buildpack was tested against a system generated by the vagrant installer: http://blog.cloudfoundry.com/2013/06/27/installing-cloud-foundry-on-vagrant/ .

# Instructions
Clone the git repo into the buildpack directory on your dea_ng node using the command:
`git clone https://github.com/davidl-zend/zend-server-mysql-buildpack-dev`

Alternatively you can clone the repo into a Web server in your environment and specify the buildpack to the cf client. 
i.e.  `cf push --buildpack=http://url-to-cloned-repo`
